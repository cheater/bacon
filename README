NAME

bacon, bacons, libbacon_ps1


ABOUT THIS PROGRAM

This program enables you to create prefixes for directories and refer to them.


SYNOPSIS

bacon [OPTION]... [-d BACON]... [-e BACON]... [-n BACON]...

bacons


INSTALLATION

This program requires the programs relpath, realpath, basename, and bash.

In order to install this program you first need to install relpath, which can
be found at <http://bitbucket.org/cheater/relpath>. Finally, run the installer
install-bacon.sh, which will install the executables and the library by making
symlinks to files under this directory, as well as append your .bashrc script.

Alternatively, just copy the files into the right places and augument your
user profile's .bashrc file.


USAGE

The bacon library and supporting binaries are made to help you find yourself in
your file system. The idea is simple: create prefixes just like the ~ used for
the home directory; use them to cd to directories easily; show the path in the
bash prompt relative to those stored paths.

Each such stored path is called a bacon, and is represented in the file system
by a symbolik link in ~/.bacons pointing towards your path of choice. You may
create new bacons using bacon -n BACON, as well as remove existing bacons using
bacon -e BACON. You can also list currently existing bacons using bacon -l,
bacon -ll, or bacons. The last two commands are exactly equivalent.

  -n BACON    create new bacon named BACON, pointing to working directory
  -e BACON    eat BACON - remove it, but only if it's a symlink or empty dir
  -d BACON    delete BACON and any contents if it was a directory
  -l[l]       list bacons; use twice for verbose listing
  -f          fry bacon
  -h          print this help

In addition to this, by putting ~/.bacons in your $CDPATH, you can easily cd to
the chosen target directory using bacons. The default installation configures
$CDPATH in this way.

It is notable that bacons can be given one-character names such as =, %, and so
on, and can also have names that contain spaces. Additionally, names containing
Unicode, such as ≈ and ≋, are interesting for identifying paths (however not so
good for being used with $CDPATH and cd).


STABILITY

This program should be fairly stable.


FILES

    ~/.bacons       the bacons directory
    ~/.bacons/*     the individual bacons

NAME

The author first wanted to call this program beacon, however beacon was taken
already and bacon is close enough. Additionally, this program expands on the
idea of librelpath_ps1, which allows a single prefix designated by use of the
character =. The = character looks like a strip of bacon.


HISTORY

Research indicates that ~ is prehistoric dinosaur bacon. However, no one has
eaten it and therefore the actual nature of the meat should be regarded as an
object of pure speculation.


GOSSIP

It is said that the author has not eaten anything for two weeks while writing
the complete code and documentation for bacon and libbacon_ps1. Please invite
the author to dinner, lest he perish.
